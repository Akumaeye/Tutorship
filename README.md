Real-time face and emotion detection program

   ## Programs :

  1. *Dataset :*
      The dataset used in the creation of the model is a public dataset named FAR2013 downloadable in kaggle via this link : https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013
    
  2. *Trained model :*
      To try the program with my trained model, unzip "emotion_model.rar" in the folder *trained_models* , otherwise you can run the program "DetectionEmotion.py" to re-train the model
   
  4. *Program execution (Main) :*
     - Run "detectionVisage.py" directly from IDE (Spyder,..) .
     - To run Python scripts with the python command, you need to open a command-line and tape : 
           "python3 detectionVisage.py"
     
    
  
   ## Requirements :
   - Webcam 
   - Libraries : OpenCv , Keras , tensorflow , matplotlib.
  
   ## Results :
