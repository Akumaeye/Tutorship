Real-time face and emotion detection program
  1. Dataset :
    * The dataset used in the creation of the model is a public dataset named FAR2013 downloadable in kaggle via this link :
    https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013
    
  2. Trained model :
    * To try the program with my trained model, unzip "trained_models.rar" , otherwise you can run the program "DetectionEmotion.py" to re-train the model
   
  4. Program execution (Main) :
     - Run "detectionVisage.py" directly from IDE (Spyder) .
     - To run Python scripts with the python command, you need to open a command-line and tape : 
           "python3 detectionVisage.py"
